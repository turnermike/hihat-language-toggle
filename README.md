# Hi-hat Language Toggle

This Wordpress plugin is used in conjunction with WPML. It is a very basic plugin that will display an English or French link depending on the current language.

## How it Works

Use the shortcode in your posts/pages, or do_shortcode('[hihat_language_toggle]') in your theme templates.

### Shortcode

    [hihat_language_toggle test_var="true"]
